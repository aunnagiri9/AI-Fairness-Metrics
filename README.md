## Roadmaps

### Phase 1: Collect publications and articles about useful statistics and matrix
* [ ] Matrix and Statistics used for assessing ML model's performance
* [ ] Matrix and Statistics used for assessing ML model's privacy
* [ ] Matrix and Statistics used for assessing ML model's explainability (Optional)
* [ ] Matrix and Statistics used for assessing training data's bias and fairness 
* [ ] Organize and categorize the Matrix and Statistics concepts
 
### Phase 2: Implementation of the Matrix and Statistics with Python codes
* [ ] Implement each Matrix and Statistics method with Python codes - Performace
* [ ] Implement each Matrix and Statistics method with Python codes - Privacy
* [ ] Implement each Matrix and Statistics method with Python codes - Bias & Fairness
* [ ] Provide some showcases
* [ ] Documentate codes with Markdown files ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) needs to be used)

### Phase 3: Visualization of the Matrix and Statistics results
* [ ] Implement the visualization of Matrix and Statistics
* [ ] Provide some showcases
* [ ] Documentate codes with Markdown files ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) needs to be used)

### Phase 4: Testing by Researchers
* [ ] Focus group with Researchers
* [ ] Collect feedback and upgrades
* [ ] Codes release and merge with Utlities repo. 

### Phase Optional: Paper draft
